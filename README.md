# Computer
Embedded Systems Project - y2023 - in collaboration with M. Morales  

For this project, we had to "create" a computer from nothing in VHDL.  
  
In order to realise this project, we had to follow a multitude of instructions helping us building the computer step by step, while testing the functionnalities we were adding with a Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA Board. When the core functionnalities of the computer were working, we added external peripheral such as a Joystick, an OLED screen an accelerometer and a Sonar and made them work together with C code.  
  
You will also find in this repository our project report, explaining everything about this project : how each component works and has been added to the project, visual representations of our PCB card in 3D with Altium, and more. (only available in French)  
  
This projet being an embedded systems project, the program will not do anything alone. You can always try to recreate our system by yourself with the help of our project report though !
